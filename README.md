Revamped entire project with the changes done through in class.
Uses firebase for user login authentication.
Deployed on Vercel.

## Known Bug:
- Add function does not completely work as there is an error stating that there is a firebase permission that is not turned on. I cannot figure out that permission or find where it is.
